## TalonOfMalarKit v1.0
for BG2: SoA/ToB
  
Malar, the god of hunters and evil lycanthropes, relishes in instilling fear and terror in his victims while tracking them down in an often long and bloody hunt.
Malar teaches that only the fittest survive and the weak need to be winnowed from the folk, often through a brutal and bloody hunt.
The exception to this are the young and the pregnant, which are supposed to be spared, so that there will always be prey to hunt.  
  
The church of Malar is loosely bound and without a central hierarchy. Local leaders, called Bloodmasters,
decide the time and place for ceremonial hunts such as the High Hunt.  
Clerics of the Beastlord, who are referred to as Talons of Malar, seek to hunt as often as possible. They try to make their hunts dangerous to prey and hunter alike and, more often then not, try to ensure the hunt's bloody finale takes place in a settled area.
  
Talons of Malar can only be of Chaotic Neutral, Neutral Evil and Chaotic Evil alignments.
